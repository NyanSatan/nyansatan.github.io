<b>diags</b> (or <b>diag</b>) is an Apple internal diagnostic program designed to run over an iBoot. It spawns shell accessible over the serial interface with a set of powerful commands (memory manipulation, editing SysCfg, NVRAM, etc.). Also optionally special menu can be spawned right on a device's display. There's no multi-touch driver however, so an user can only use buttons for a navigation:

<h2>The ways to boot diags</h2>
<b>Note</b>: Everything in this article is about iOS 6.x bootloaders<br><br>
In both <b>RELEASE</b>- and <b>DEVELOPMENT</b>-fused iBoots (only talking about flashable iBoot, not iBEC) there's a routine for booting diags:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/diags_boot_command.png"><br>

In RELEASE bootloaders it only works as a <b>boot-command</b> (so it will be executed automatically if <span class="cli">boot-command</span> iBoot/NVRAM variable is set to <span class="cli">diags</span>), in DEVELOPMENT it works both as a boot-command and as a normal command accessible through the command shell<br><br>

As you can see on the screenshot above, first it tries to find and boot an image of type <span class="cli">diag</span> in <b>NOR</b> (by the term "NOR" I mean a storage where boot images are situated, depending on a device it can be either the <b>1 MB SPI NOR chip</b> or the special partition on NAND, which is usually referred by iBoot as "<b>nand_firmware</b>"). If it fails to do so, it tries to find the image on a filesystem defined by <span class="cli">boot-partition</span> variable on a device defined by <span class="cli">boot-device</span> variable using path defined by <span class="cli">diags-path</span> or <span class="cli">diags-vendor-path</span> variables (not sure what'sÂ the difference between them)<br><br>

For some unobvious reason, I wasn't able to use the original routine to boot diags, so I invented a tiny patch for iBoot to see it through. This also obviates need of touching NOR or filesystem<br>

<h2>The patch</h2>

First of all we have to locate the original diags routines. This can be easily done by using <b>iBoot32Patcher</b>:
<p class="cli">iboot32patcher iBoot.decrypted /dev/null -c diags 0x0</p>
<img class="align" src="resources/diags_offset.png"><br>
In this case it's located at <b>0x4FF0093D minus 0x1</b>. The address is stored increased by one because <b>least significant bit</b> (<b>LSB</b>, bit 0) must be 1, if this code is written in <b>Thumb</b> (it is in our case)<br>

Now find a function with this address and scroll to the end of it:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/jumpto_original.png"><br>

This code is responsible to finally boot an unpacked and validated image, it's decompilation would look in this way:
<p class="cli">jumpto(5, 0x40000000, 0, 0)</p>
Where <span class="cli">5</span> is a kind of mode of jumping, 5th is designed to boot diags; and <span class="cli">0x40000000</span> is a <b>load address</b>. Load address is a place in memory where loaded from NOR/filesystem or uploaded over USB images are stored<br><br>

Note that <b>0x40000000</b> is loaded from the function's stack, and this is indeed a problem since we're not going to execute the whole function. Let's fix it. NOP out the LDR and BL before it:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/jumpto_nopped.png"><br><br>

Then replace 2 last NOPs with <span class="cli">MOV R1, LOADADDR</span>. For <b>s5l8900x</b>-<b>s5l8720x</b> load address is 0x09000000, for <b>s5l8920x</b>-<b>s5l8930x</b> is 0x40000000 and for <b>s5l8940x</b>-<b>s5l8955x</b> is 0x80000000:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/jumpto_patched.png"><br>

Now compute the difference and apply it to the original file. Now comes a tricky part, using iBoot32Patcher point <b>ticket</b> command to <b>the address where your <span class="cli">MOV R1, LOADADDR</span> starts (0x4FF00A00 in my case) plus 0x1</b> (remember the LSB thing?):<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/cmd_handler_patched.png"><br>

Pack the patched file:
<p class="cli">image3maker -t ibec -f iBoot.patched -o iBoot.img3</p>
<img class="align" src="resources/image3_packed.png"><br><br>

Unpack a diags image3, they're usually unencrypted:
<p class="cli">xpwntool diag.img3 diag.raw</p>

Now load the patched iBoot, send the image and <b>ticket</b> command:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/diags_send_and_execute.png"><br><br>

After about 7-10 seconds device's display should turn purple. The shell is now ready to receive commands. Launch some program for reading/writing over UART and send <span class="cli">menu -a</span> command:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/menu-a.png"><br><br>

The menu should now appear on the display. You can also send <span class="cli">help</span> to get the list of all available features. Yes, an output from diags is very messy<br><br>
