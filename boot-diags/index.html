<h1>Booting diags from iBoot recovery shell</h1>
<div class="desc">Created on 19.04.19</div>

<div class="p"><b>Important note:</b> this article discusses Apple internal software. This information is provided for educational purposes only. Also playing with low-level software directly may lead to a hardware damage. You have been warned
</div>

<div class="p">
<h2>The problem</h2>

<div class="p">
Originally <b>diags</b> are loaded either by <b>diags</b> shell command or by <b>diags</b> boot-command. Both use the same routine that first tries to find diags in NOR/nand_firmware and if fails tries to load it from filesystem with index from <b>boot-partition</b> environment variable with path taken from <b>diags-path</b>/<b>diags-vendor-path</b> variable
</div>

<div class="p">
On <b>RELEASE</b>-fused iBoot the shell command isn't available at all (since iPhone OS 3.1). The boot-command is still there (only on 2nd-stage flashable variant called "iBoot"), but requires many actions: patch signature checks, patch boot-command hardcoded variable in iBoot to always have value <b>diags</b>, put diags image on filesystem and create <b>diags-path</b> variable
</div>

<div class="p">
In my opinion in many cases it would be more convinient to load diags using recovery shell. But on newer devices (e.g. iPhone 5) if you simply send an image over USB and send <b>go</b>-command, it won't work, you'll only get a black screen
</div>

<div class="p">
The solution for that is very simple though and requires literally one byte patch (among signature check patch of course)
</div>

</div>

<br>

<div class="p">
<h2>The solution</h2>
<div class="p">
There's a function in every iBoot called <span class="cli">prepare_and_jump</span>. Its prototype:

<p class="cli">
void prepare_and_jump(enum boot_target boot, void *ptr, void *arg)
</p>

</div>

<div class="p">
It's used to perform jumps to various images: like another iBoot, kernel or diags
</div>




<div class="p">
Let's talk about args it takes:
<ul>
<li><b>boot</b> - boot target. Available targets:
<p class="cli">
	BOOT_UNKNOWN = 0<br>
	BOOT_HALT<br>
	BOOT_IBOOT<br>
	BOOT_DARWIN<br>
	BOOT_DARWIN_RESTORE<br>
	BOOT_DIAGS<br>
	BOOT_TSYS<br>
	BOOT_SECUREROM<br>
	BOOT_MONITOR<br>
	BOOT_DALI
</p>
</li>

<li><b>ptr</b> - pointer to raw image to jump on or sometimes to a boot trampoline</li>

<li><b>arg</b> - pointer to raw image when a boot trampoline is used</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">
<b>go</b>-command uses <span class="cli">BOOT_UNKNOWN</span> (0x0). It's fine for booting iBoot, but not diags. What we're going to do here is to make it use <span class="cli">BOOT_DIAGS</span> (0x5) instead
</div>

</div>

<br>

<div class="p">
<h2>The patch</h2>
<div class="p">
First we need to find <b>go</b>-command handler function. It's very easy - it always prints something like <i>jumping into image at 0x44000000</i>, so we can find it by searching where such string is used:<br>

<img class="align" src="resources/patch.png"><br>

First argument for <span class="cli">prepare_and_jump</span> is loaded from <b>R0</b> according to the calling conventions. Patch this <span class="cli">MOVS R0, #0</span> to be <span class="cli">MOVS R0, #5</span> (<span class="cli">00 20</span> to <span class="cli">05 20</span>):<br>

<img class="align" src="resources/patched.png"><br>

</div>

<div class="p">
That's all. Don't forget to patch signature checks. And then you can send Image3 with diags over USB and jump to it just by sending <b>go</b>-command
