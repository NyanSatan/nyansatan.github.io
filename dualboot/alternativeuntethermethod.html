<title>iOS Dualboot - Alternative untether method</title>

</head>

<body>

<div class="main">

<h1>Alternative untether method</h1>

Technique we'll talk about was originally discovered by <b>@iH8sn0w</b> and used in his <b>iBooty</b>. For dualboot it was first used by <b>@ShadowLee19</b><br><br>

Instead of kloadering both iBSS+iBEC and making them load orderly, let's follow more native way - 
use NOR-section of device's NAND to store secondary bootloader, just where all original IMG3s are stored<br><br>

So our untether will work in following way:<br>

<ol type="1">
<li>You load specially-patched LLB using kloader</li><br>
<li>LLB looks into NOR for image with identity <span class="cli">ibec</span> (special patch is needed, originally it looks for <span class="cli">ibot</span>) and loads it. iBEC image must still be decrypted</li><br>
<li>iBEC mounts third partition, grabs boot components and loads them all just like in case of iBSS+iBEC method</li><br>
</ol>
<i>@ShadowLee19's technique is a little bit different by the way. Instead of iBEC he used iBoot, which also requires DeviceTree and logos to be flashed to NOR as well</i><br><br>
<h2>Patching LLB</h2>

After its initialization LLB looks for IMG3 with tag <span class="cli">ibot</span> and if such image was found, LLB will validate, decrypt and jump to it, otherwise it will switch to DFU-Mode:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/llbinit.png"><br>
Go to <span class="cli">do_boot</span> function, its call should be right before <span class="cli">LDR R0, =#AddressToDoBootString</span> (in this case it was recognized properly):<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/do_boot.png"><br>
Patch these <span class="cli">MOV R0</span> instructions to make this LLB load IMG3 with any identity you want (use <a class="blacklink" href="http://armconverter.com">ARM To Hex Converter</a> to convert ARM instructions in their hexadecimal representations). For example, <span class="cli">ibec</span>:<br><br>
<img class="align" src="resources/do_bootpatched.png"><br>
Signature checks must be patched as well, obviously. It may be easily done using <b>iBoot32Patcher</b><br><br>

<h2>Flashing iBEC</h2>
First of all patch (and pack it into IMG3 obviously) iBEC as described in <a class="blacklink" href="patchingbootchain.html">Part 5</a> of this guide and make sure it works properly thrice<br><br>
Unfortunately, you'll need to restore your device, because the best way to flash non-original IMG3s to device is packing them into IPSW and adding them to <span class="cli">all_flash</span> manifest<br><br>

Unzip IPSW, go to <span class="cli">all_flash</span> directory and place your iBEC here with name beginning with <span class="cli">iBoot</span> or some else original component's name:<br>
<img class="align" src="resources/all_flash.png">
...because otherwise <b>idevicerestore</b> will fail restore:<br>
<img class="align" src="resources/failedrestore.png">

Now open <span class="cli">manifest</span> and add your iBEC's filename to the end of it:<br>
<img class="align" src="resources/manifest.png">

Pack your IPSW and restore. You'll know iBEC was flashed properly if its name appeared in <b>idevicerestore</b>'s log:
<img class="align" src="resources/flashed.png">

In <b>Way Out</b> disable <b>multi_kloader</b> option and type path to your patched LLB (it must remain unpacked raw image):<br><br>
